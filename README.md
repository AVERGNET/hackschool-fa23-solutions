# Hack School Fall 2023 - Part 4

To get started, we will first create a backend directory, using:

```
$ mkdir backend 
$ cd backend
```

Then, we will be initializing a Node.js app, and installing Express.js. This can be achieved using:

```
$ npm init -y
$ npm install express

```

Optionally, you can use `nodemon` to automaticallt restart the server if you make changes to the 
code:

```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```



Todo: Test the STUB HTTP responses on Postman to ensure they work.
